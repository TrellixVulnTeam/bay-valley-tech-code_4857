// defining a variable with const, makes it consatant. unable to change.

//Javascript, runs twice, once to chack and a second to actually declare everything
//if use a variable before it is defined with car, it shows undefined,
// if used let, will throw an error
//better to use let, unless absolutely needed. (not ever in this course)

var MyVariable = 2;
let MyVarianle2 = 4;
const MyVariable3 = 7;

// conditionals  === is for comparing value and type as well

//falsey and truthy values
// !! converts the variable to the boolean of its value
//or just use boolean
//can set variable to Boolean, number or string with <type>(<variabe>)

//for numbers, all values are truthy except 0 
//all strings are truthy, except for an empty string
//for arrays, it is always truthy, if it's defines, it's truthy.
//undefined is also falsey
//null is falsey


//to check the type typeof(<variable>);

//for strings can use '' or "" or ``
// putting a \ before a command, tells the compiler that it is to be taken as a 
// character, not a command
//ex.. \" will print ", not use it as a functional



//with less than and greater than on strings, it compares strings alphabettically 



//calling variable in middle of string use ${} or " + "
